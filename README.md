# plannter

A web application, allowing the user to select plants to be grown, in order to see a summary of work to be done at a particular time. The application allows the user to configure weekly mail reminders on the work to be done in the garden.

This web application was created as the final project of the CS50x course. The distribution code for pset9 was used as a starting point (see https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/9/finance/).
